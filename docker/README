This directory contains the files necessary to build a Docker image for
running the version of OpenQM maintained in this repository.

To build the image, run the docker-build.sh script, which will create an
image with the tag openqm:latest.

To run the image, docker-run.sh provides a sample recommended run command.

Current verions of this image will be published on Docker Hub under
racingmars/openqm (https://hub.docker.com/r/racingmars/openqm). For the image
documentation, see README.DockerHub.md, which contains the image description
published on Docker Hub.
